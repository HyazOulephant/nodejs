# API seeduino LoRaWAN kit
This project is my first and simple attempt to build a Node server from scratch on my own. It simply make a query on a db from a form post. It only accept node names filtered by regex.

You will also find my web research on LoRaWAN security, the database of the original webserver given with the kit and my translated french documentation.
